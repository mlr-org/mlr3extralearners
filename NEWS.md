# mlr3extralearners 0.7.1-9000

* re-added the catboost learner as it was requested (was previously removed

* Add feature type `"factor"` to gam learners
* Add new parameter `min.bucket` to ranger

# mlr3extralearners 0.6.0

*   Feat: Added learner `LearnerClassifGlmer` (https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3extralearners/issues/243)

    `ordered_features()` like in `mlr3learners` and therefore obviate the need to
    store `feature_names` in the `state`
