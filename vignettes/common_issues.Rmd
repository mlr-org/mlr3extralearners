This vignette lists some common issues that one should pay attention to when implementing a `Learner`.

## Ordering Features

When implementing the private `$.predict()` method it is a good idea to retrieve the columns in the same order as they were during `$.train()`.
While this might not matter in most cases, we have encountered examples where this was necessary to ensure that the learner worked as expected.
The data can be accessed in the corrected order via the `ordered_features` helper function.

## Accessing Internals From `$state`

Sometimes, one needs additional information that might not be stored in the machine learning model itself.
In such cases, one might be tempted to access data from the `$state` of a `Learner` beyond the `$state$model`.
However, this is a rather internal data structure that might change in the future and one should not rely on it.
Furthermore, the `$state` that is created when a learner is `resample`d is not the same that is created in a manual `$train()`.
If you absolutely need additional information, you can make the private `$.train()` method return a `list()` with the actual model and this additional metadata and then subset this list accordingly in `$.predict()` to access the relevant data.
In such cases, it is a good idea to first consult with the maintainer of `mlr3extralearners` if this is really necessary.

## Default vs. Initial Parameters

When creating a parameter (via `p_dbl()` and friends), there are two similar arguments that can be specified, namely the `init` and `default`.
On the one hand, the argument `default` should describe the default value that the upstream package uses when no specific value is set.
E.g., if one were to connect the linear model to `mlr3`, the default for the parameter `singualr.ok` can be accessed via `formals(lm)$singular.ok`.
These default values do not set any specific parameter values in the `$param_set` of the `Learner`.
On the other hand, the `init` field describes to what the parameter value should be initialized to.
By default, it is not initialized to any value, which means that the default behavior will be used.


## Complex Defaults

When annotating the default value for a parameter in the `ParamSet`, there are cases where defaults are relatively complex.
E.g. an integer value might be set to `sample.int(100L)` per default.
In such cases, it is ok to not specify any `default` value for the parameter, which `paradox` then interpretes as having a complex default.
