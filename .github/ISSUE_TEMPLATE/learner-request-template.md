### Algorithm

<Random Forest>

### Package

<randomForest>

### Supported types

* [ ] classif
* [ ] regr
* [ ] surv
* [ ] dens

### I have checked that this is not already implemented in

  * [ ] mlr3
  * [ ] mlr3learners
  * [ ] mlr3extralearners
  * [ ] Other core packages (e.g. mlr3proba)

### Why do I think this is a useful learner?

### Further Optional Comments

(e.g. if this algorithm is already implemented under a different learner then please explain why this additional implementation is useful)
