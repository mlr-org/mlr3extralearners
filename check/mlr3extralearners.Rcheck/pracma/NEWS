    o reshape(), repmat(), and blkdiag() matrix functions.
    o combs() chooses all combinations of k elements out of n, and
      randcomb() generates a random selection.
    o perms() generates all permutations, randperm() a random permutation.
    o Pascal triangle as pascal(); nchoosek() returns binomial coefficients.
    o Some string functions: strcmp(), strcmpi(), strcat().


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-8 (2011-03-10)

    o std() as refinement of the standard deviation function.
    o ceil() and fix() as aliases for ceiling() and trunc().
      [floor() and round() already exist in R.]
    o Modulo functions mod(), rem() and integer division idiv().
    o Integer functions related to the Euclidean algorithm:
      extgcd(), gcd(), lcm(), coprime(), and modinv().
    o distmat() and crossn(), the vector product in n-dimensional space.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-7 (2011-03-08)

    o size(), numel(), ndims(), isempty(), and find().
    o eye(), ones(), zeros().
    o Functions returning random numbers: rand(), randn(), randi().
    o linspace(), logspace(), and logseq() for linearly, logarithmically,
      and exponentially spaced sequences.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-6 (2011-03-06)

    o Matrix functions mdiag() and mtrace() added.
      inv() is introduced as an alias for solve() in R.
    o Generate special matrices hankel(), rosser(), and wilkinson().
      kron() is an alias for the R function kronecker().
    o Renamed factors() to ifactor() to distinguish it more clearly
      from factors as used in R.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-5

    o Added function for flipping or rotating numeric and complex
      matrices: flipdim(). flipud(), fliplr(), and rot90().

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-4

    o Added functions for generating sequences of (log-)linearly spaced
      numeric values: linspace() and logspace().
    o Added basic complex functions real(), imag(), conj(), and angle()
      which are essentially only aliases of the R functions Re(), Im(),
      or Conj().
      angle() returns the angle of a complex number in radians. The R
      function Mod() is here only available as abs().

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-3 (2011-02-20)

    o Added compan() function for the `companion' matrix;
      the eig() function is an alias for the R eigen()values function.
    o Added the polynomial functions poly(), polyder(), polyfit(),
      polyint(), and polyval().
    o roots() returns real and complex roots of polynomials.
    o Simplified the trapz() function.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-2

    o Added functions from number theory: primes(), isprime() and factors().
      The corresponding function for factors() in MATLAB/Octave is called
      factor(), but that name should not be shadowed in R!
    o Added the polyarea() and trapz() functions.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1-1

    o Added some simple functions such as nthroot(), pow2(), and nextpow2().
    o dot() and cross() functions for scalar and vector product.
    o Generate matrices through vander() and hilb().

INITIAL VERSION 0.1-0

  INSTALLATION

    o 'pracma' will be a pure R package without using any source code.
      Therefore, installation will be immediate on all platforms.

  INTENTION

    o This package provides R implementations of more advanced math
      functions from MATLAB and Octave (and the Euler Math Toolbox)
      with a special view on optimization and time series routines.
