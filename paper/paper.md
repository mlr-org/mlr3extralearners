# Summary

- Background on mlr3:
  - unified interface for ML in R
  - mention that we don't implement methods ourselves but just wrap them
  - mlr3 is nothing without its learners
  - mention other packgages such as mlr3learners, mlr3torch and mlr3proba

- Comparison with other packages:
  - parsnip tidymodels
  - ???

- License of the package

# Statement of Need

- No ML without learners:
  - people have to rewrite the same learners
- Give people the ability to contribute their own methods to the ecosystem

# Features

- Ease of use
  - benefit from the whole ecosystem:
    - annotate parameter spaces that make tuning the learner easier
    - Examples for how to user learner
    - preprocessing via mlr3pipelines
    - tuning via mlr3tuning

- Functional correctness
  - parameter tests
  - sanity tests

- Community-driven integration of new learners:
  - distinguish between mlr3learners and mlr3extralearners
  - Mention tutorial on website
  - Mention template-generating functions for tests and learner
